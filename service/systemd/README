Select appropriate systemd service based on your compile settings. If you
enabled WITH_SYSTEMD, use mosquitto.service.notify, otherwise use
mosquitto.service.simple. The service must be renamed to mosquitto.service
before usage. Don't forget to change default paths in service file if you
changed the default build settings.

With WITH_SYSTEMD mosquitto will notify a complete startup after
initialization. This means that follow-up units can be started after full
initialization of mosquitto (i.e. sockets are opened).

Use mosquitto.socket for socket activation. This functionality is
always available (even if WITH_SYSTEMD is disabled) because it does not
depend on any systemd includes or libraries.

Mosquitto recognizes the environment variables
LISTEN_FDS and LISTEN_PID as set by systemd.
All sockets must be mentioned exactly
the same way in the mosquitto.conf:

listener 1883 127.0.0.1
listener 1883 ::1
listener 0 /run/mosquitto/s

Other socket managing capable service managers like s6 can also
use this mechanism.
