# Test whether a client sends a correct PUBLISH to a topic with QoS 1 and responds to a delay.

# The client should connect to port 1888 with keepalive=60, clean session set,
# and client id publish-qos1-test
# The test will send a CONNACK message to the client with rc=0. Upon receiving
# the CONNACK the client should verify that rc==0. If not, it should exit with
# return code=1.
# On a successful CONNACK, the client should send a PUBLISH message with topic
# "pub/qos1/test", payload "message" and QoS=1.
# The test will not respond to the first PUBLISH message, so the client must
# resend the PUBLISH message with dup=1. Note that to keep test durations low, a
# message retry timeout of less than 10 seconds is required for this test.
# On receiving the second PUBLISH message, the test will send the correct
# PUBACK response. On receiving the correct PUBACK response, the client should
# send a DISCONNECT message.
